## Data Modeling
The data model follows a **Star Schema** design:  
- **Fact Table**  
  - `order.Fact`: contains order details, income, date, and time.  
- **Dimension Tables**  
  - `menu_items.Dim`: categories, item names, prices.  
  - `Date.Dim`: calendar and time intelligence.  
  - `Events.Dim`: special events and dates.  
- **Helper Tables**  
  - `Measures Table`:store measures and calculations.
  - `Measure_Selection`: store and switch measures dynamically.  
  - `Products`: product-level grouping for analysis.  
- **created a Date Dimension table from scratch using Power Query.**
 - This table covers the full date range of the dataset and includes additional columns for detailed analysis.
 - By building this table manually instead of relying only on raw order dates, the model supports Consistent time-based slicers (Year, Month, Week, Day).
